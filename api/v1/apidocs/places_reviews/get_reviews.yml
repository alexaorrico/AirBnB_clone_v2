We were traveling for a girls trip, and had 4 of us staying at the house. We found it very comfortable, and were very happy to have laundry in unit! ",

The space was clean and the decor made it feel so homey. We loved the bathroom! Hanan was a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we needed. We could not have asked for a better experience for our first Airbnb stay!",
