Status of your API

API This file reads the title of the folder and project execution:

The DOCUMENTATION folder was created by Nnenna John.

Create a folder api at the root of the project with an empty file __init__.py
Create a folder v1 inside api:
create an empty file __init__.py
create a file app.py:
create a variable app, instance of Flask
import storage from models
import app_views from api.v1.views
register the blueprint app_views to your Flask instance app
declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext that calls storage.close()
inside if __name__ == "__main__":, run your Flask server (variable app) with:
host = environment variable HBNB_API_HOST or 0.0.0.0 if not defined
port = environment variable HBNB_API_PORT or 5000 if not defined
threaded=True
Create a folder views inside v1:
create a file __init__.py:
import Blueprint from flask doc
create a variable app_views which is an instance of Blueprint (url prefix must be /api/v1)
wildcard import of everything in the package api.v1.views.index => PEP8 will complain about it, don’t worry, it’s normal and this file (v1/views/__init__.py) won’t be check.
create a file index.py
import app_views from api.v1.views
create a route /status on the object app_views that returns a JSON: "status": "OK" (see example)
