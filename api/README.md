# 0x05. AirBnB clone - RESTful API
REST API is a software architectural style for Backend.

REST = “REpresentational State Transfer”. API = Application Programming Interface

Its purpose is to induce performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.

REST API is Resource-based, a resource is an object and can be access by a URI. An object is “displayed”/transferred via a representation (typically JSON). HTTP methods will be actions on a resource.
