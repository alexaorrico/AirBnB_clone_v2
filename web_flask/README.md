# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web framework

## Description
This project's goal is to learn what a web framework is, through the installation and configuration of Flask on the AirBnB clone.

## Table of contents

**1. Python scripts**

All the .py files are Flask scripts that start a Flask app.
Up until 6-number_odd_or_even.py, the scripts are just training.
After this, the scripts each start a Flask app with a different routing, linked to the AirBnB clone storage.

**2. Templates**

All the files in the [templates](./templates) directory are HTML templates for the Flask scripts to render.
