Web Flask
This was a sub-project within AirBnB in which I began working with Flask and Jinja2. In this project, I began integrating the back-end storage engine with the web static HTML/CSS pages written earlier.

Files 0 - 6 were introductory tasks familiarizing myself with using Flask. Files 7 forward involved gradually putting together more and more complex Jinja templates based on the HBnB HTML pages.
