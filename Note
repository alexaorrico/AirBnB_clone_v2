This is a command line instruction for running Python unit tests using the unittest module with environment variables set.

Here's what each part of the command does:

HBNB_ENV=test sets the HBNB_ENV environment variable to test
HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test sets the HBNB_MYSQL_USER environment variable to hbnb_test
HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd sets the HBNB_MYSQL_PWD environment variable to hbnb_test_pwd
HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost sets the HBNB_MYSQL_HOST environment variable to localhost
HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db sets the HBNB_MYSQL_DB environment variable to hbnb_test_db
HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db sets the HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE environment variable to db
python3 -m unittest discover tests runs the unittest module and discovers all tests in the tests directory
2>&1 /dev/null redirects standard error output to standard output and discards it
tail -n 1 displays the last line of output, which contains the summary of the test results
