This is our contribution to the AirBnB Clone project. We have worked on updating and enhancing the codebase according to the given requirements. The project aims to provide a Python-based implementation of an AirBnB-like application with specific coding standards and unit tests.

Project Requirements:
- Python Scripts
  - Editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
  - Files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
  - PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
  - All files must be executable
  - Length of files will be tested using wc
  - Modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation
- Python Unit Tests
  - Editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - Test files should be inside a folder "tests" and have the extension .py
  - Test files and folders should start by "test_"
  - File organization in the tests folder should mirror the project's structure
  - All tests should be executed using "python3 -m unittest discover tests"
  - Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover edge cases.

Let's work together to make this project better!
