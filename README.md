0x05. AirBnB clone - RESTful API

#0. Restart from scratch!
Question: No no no! We are already too far in the project to restart everything.

But once again, let’s work on a new codebase.

For this project you will fork this codebase:

Update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v3
Update the README.md:
Add yourself as an author of the project
Add new information about your new contribution
Make it better!
If you’re the owner of this codebase, create a new repository called AirBnB_clone_v3 and copy over all files from AirBnB_clone_v2
