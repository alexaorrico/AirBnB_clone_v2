# Requirements
##### Python Scripts
##### Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
##### All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
##### All your files should end with a new line
##### The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
##### A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
##### Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
##### All your files must be executable
##### The length of your files will be tested using wc
##### All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
##### All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
##### All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
##### A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
##### Python Unit Tests
##### Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
##### All your files should end with a new line
##### All your test files should be inside a folder tests
##### You have to use the unittest module
##### All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
##### All your test files and folders should start by test_
##### Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
##### All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
##### You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
##### We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases
##### GitHub
##### There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.
