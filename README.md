# AirBnB clone - RESTful API
Building RESTful web services, like other programming skills is part art, part science. As the Internet industry progresses, creating a REST API becomes more concrete with emerging best practices. As RESTful web services don't follow a prescribed standard except for HTTP, it's important to build your RESTful API in accordance with industry best practices to ease development and increase client adoption.

Presently, there aren't a lot of REST API guides to help the lonely developer. RestApiTutorial.com is dedicated to tracking REST API best practices and making resources available to enable quick reference and self education for the development crafts-person. We'll discuss both the art and science of creating REST Web services.

**Client-Server:** There should be a separation between the server that offers a service, and the client that consumes it.
**Stateless:** Each request from a client must contain all the information required by the server to carry out the request. In other words, the server cannot store information provided by the client in one request and use it in another request.
**Cacheable:** The server must indicate to the client if requests can be cached or not.
**Layered System:** Communication between a client and a server should be standardized in such a way that allows intermediaries to respond to requests instead of the end server, without the client having to do anything different.
**Uniform Interface:** The method of communication between a client and a server must be uniform.
**Code on demand:** Servers can provide executable code or scripts for clients to execute in their context. This constraint is the only one that is optional.
