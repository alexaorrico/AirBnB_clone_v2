### Introduction

Welcome to the first phase of our ambitious four-phase project, aimed at creating a remarkable replica of the renowned AirBnB web application. In this initial stage, we've developed a powerful console using Python's Cmd module. This console serves as the command center for managing various objects within the entire project. You can perform fundamental operations like creating, displaying, updating, listing, and deleting objects across different classes and subclasses.

### System Environment

Our console was meticulously crafted in the Ubuntu 14.04LTS environment, utilizing Python3 (version 3.4) for its core functionality.

### Additional Information

### System Requirements

To embark on this journey with us, you'll need a solid grasp of Python3, familiarity with using command line interpreters, a computer running Ubuntu 14.04, Python3, and a handy PEP8 style checker.
